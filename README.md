The MAX31855 uses SPI and ties up 3 digital outputs on the master device.  There is a 1-wire version [MAX31850K](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1727)

## Info

The MAX31855K does everything for you, and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller, even one without an analog input. This breakout board has the chip itself, a 3.3V regulator with 10uF bypass capacitors and level shifting circuitry, all assembled and tested. For use with
[type K thermocouples](http://www.adafruit.com/products/270)
